Hello! Welcome to Ziggums' Magic 8 Ball!

This is a practice project as I teach myself how to program using various languages! I had previously coded this in Python (albeit with quite a bit of assistance) so I am redoing it all on my own as I get back in to learning to write code!

I'm using this as a simple practice in Ruby (as that is my target language at the moment) and have also added it in git to practice my git management skills.

Please ignore any shoddy code, or at least provide updates!
